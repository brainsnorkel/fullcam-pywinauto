# fullcam-pywinauto

A Python utility for automating [FullCAM.exe][1] simulation and exports. A (fragile) script that will work its way through a csv of the format in [example-locations.csv][2] possibly useful as a model for anyone  looking to use FullCAM for automating a large set of tasks.

# Getting Started

Install FullCAM.exe somewhere convenient and note the location.

If you don’t already have a python environment, install Canopy (free edition) and use the Canopy Command Line to “pip install pywinauto” - or otherwise set up your Python with the pywinauto package installed. 

Load the Python source file in Canopy - change the variables in the header of the python file to match where you have things stored, and what directory you want to send output xls to… and run.
